## GoPiGo3 Camera Mount 
3d printable parts for mounting the Raspi camera v2 to the GoPiGo 3 robot. In addition a couple of m3 bolts and nuts are needed, see picture. The back and frontside that encase the camera can be glued together with Superglue/Cyanacrylate but you will never get them apart again. It's easier but looks hackish to use duct tape.

The distance sensor can then be mounted below the mount by drilling two ~2 mm holes into the front and using two M2 bolts and nuts. See picture.
