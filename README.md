## camera holder
3d printable parts for mounting the Raspi camera v2 to the gopigo. In addition a couple of m3 bolts and nuts are needed, see picture. The back and frontside that encase the camera can be glued together with Superglue/Cyanacrylate but you will never get them apart again. It's easier but looks hackish to use duct tape.
